# Data Mining Algorithms Repository

Welcome to our data mining algorithms repository! In this repository, you will find implementations of various data mining algorithms along with their corresponding datasets and models. We aim to provide a comprehensive resource for both theoretical understanding and practical application of these algorithms.

## Introduction

This repository is a collaborative effort between [Pravin Kumar](https://github.com/pr093) and [Pulkit Kapoor](https://github.com/Pulkit2642), created as part of our data mining classes. Our goal is to explore different data mining techniques, experiment with real-world datasets, and build models to analyze and extract valuable insights.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into different directories, each focusing on a specific data mining algorithm. Within each directory, you will find the following components:

1. **Code**: Implementing the algorithm in Python programming language.
2. **Datasets**: Real-world datasets used for experimentation.
3. **Models**: Trained models generated from the datasets.
4. **Documentation**: Theoretical explanations and practical insights into the algorithm.

## Getting Started

To get started with exploring our repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/pravinkr05/data-mining-algorithms.git

2. Navigate to the directory of the algorithm you're interested in.

3. Explore the code, datasets, models, and documentation provided.

4. Experiment with the code by running it on your datasets or modifying it as needed.
